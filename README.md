play music on spotify and it shows the lyrics, title and artist. but the lyrics don't sync with the music most of the time lol. it uses matplotlib, spotipy and web scraping to get the lyrics.

what u need:

clientID and clientSecret (use spotify for developers)
VBCable (download it online)
press f to fullscreen
